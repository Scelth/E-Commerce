    Create two applications. 
    1. Admin panel
    2. User panel. 

    The program will be E commerce, that is, the purchase and sale of goods. 

    The administrator can add, delete, and edit categories and products.
    The user can buy products. Implement the authorization logic.
    Be sure to make a basket.

    P.S. When confirming the basket, sending a check to the mail will be an additional point. 
    If the user has not logged in, he can confirm the shopping cart.
    Do it via MVVM.
